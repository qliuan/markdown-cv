## Academic Projects

`Jan. 2018 - May. 2018`
__Data & Visual Analytics__

- repo: https://github.com/qliuan/CX4242
- containing four assignments:
- 1. collected data from Twitter REST API, visualized the data using **Gephi**, stored the data in **SQLite**, used D3.js to visualize the data, used **Google Refine** for data cleaning and practiced **Flask** and **JQuery** for Web Dev.
- 2. visualized the data using **Tableau**, finished a force-directed graph, a scatter plot, a heatmap, a dendrogram (collapsible tree) and a choropleth map using D3.js.
- 3. tried out analyzing data using **Hadoop**, **Spark/Scala**, **PIG on AWS**, **Hadoop on Microsoft Azure** and used **Azure ML Studio** for regression model. 
- 4. completed a scalable single-PC PageRank program on 70M edge graph using **Pypy**, implemented Random Forest Classifier and practiced **Scikit-Learn**.

`Jan. 2018 - May. 2018`
__Introduction to Database Systems__

- repo: https://github.com/qliuan/vue
- studied the principles of database management system in the lectures.
- designed the data tables, constraints and wrote up **SQL** language for retrieving data in a given context.
- built a web application solution using **node.js**, **vue.js** and **MySQL** database.

`Sept. 2017 - Nov. 2017`
__Introduction to AI__

- repo: https://github.com/qliuan/AI_Of_Felix_the_Cat
- used **Scikit-Learn** and **tensorflow** to build an AI for the board game “Felix the Cat”.
- a **supervised learning method SVM** achieved 40% winning rate in a 4-player game with baseline 25% winning rate.
- a **reinforcement learning AI** achieved only 30% winning rate due to lack of training time.
