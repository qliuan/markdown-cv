## Academic Projects

`Jan. 2018 - May. 2018`
__Data & Visual Analytics__

- repo: https://github.com/qliuan/CX4242
- containing four assignments:
- 1. collected data from Twitter REST API, visualized the data using Gephi, stored the data in SQLite, used D3.js to visualize the data, used Google Refine for data cleaning and practiced Flask and JQuery for Web Dev.
- 2. visualized the data using Tableau, finished a force-directed graph, a scatter plot, a heatmap, a dendrogram (collapsible tree) and a choropleth map using D3.js.
- 3. tried out analyzing data using Hadoop, Spark/Scala, PIG on AWS, Hadoop on Microsoft Azure and used Azure ML Studio for regression model. 
- 4. completed a scalable single-PC PageRank program on 70M edge graph using Pypy, implemented Random Forest Classifier and practiced Scikit-Learn.

`Jan. 2018 - May. 2018`
__Introduction to Database Systems__

- repo: https://github.com/qliuan/vue
- studied the principles of database management system in the lectures.
- designed the data tables, constraints and wrote up SQL language for retrieving data in a given context.
- built a web application solution using node.js, vue.js and MySQL database.

`Sept. 2017 - Nov. 2017`
__Introduction to AI__

- repo: https://github.com/qliuan/AI_Of_Felix_the_Cat
- used scikit-learn and tensorflow to build an AI for the board game “Felix the Cat”.
- a supervised learning method SVM achieved 40% winning rate in a 4-player game with baseline 25% winning rate.
- a reinforcement learning AI achieved only 30% winning rate due to lack of training time.

__Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program HKUST - Machine Learning on Wearable Devices__


- tried out major machine learning models using “scikit-learn” to anticipate people’s emotions based on their walking videos. 
- designed and conducted the collection of emotion and video data while people walking. 
- selected motion parameters and features to feed machine learning models using “caffe-yolo”.

`Jun. 2016 - Aug. 2016`
__Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program HKUST - Visual-based Formation Flight of Micro Aerial Vehicles__


- assembled a quardrotor and tuned up the bluetooth and Pixhawk Flight Controller using qgroundcontrol.
- succeeded to fly the aerial vehicle and obtained flying experience.
- designed a user interface (UI) for easy sending instructions to the vehicle by a single click.
 
`Sept. 2014`
__Chinese National Physics Olympiad__

- won the 1st class prize in Hunan Province out of all 390,000 high schoolers.
